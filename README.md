# node-timer
cli timer with a sound and timestamp!

# Install

run `npm install -g` and then just use the command timer on your terminal!

# Modes

For now there are two modes: timer and pomodoro. With timer an argument is required, it has to be a integer and it will iterate through the sound and cli logging with an interval of minutes given by argument. Pomodoro just iterates through 25 and 5 minutes!
